# Anonpack
A resource pack in the making. This is entirely for my own personal use but I don't mind others using it.



Features


11 is replaced by Bye Bye There! from Pizza Tower.

5 is replaced by Calzonification from the same game.

Stal is replaced by the Withered Symbiont's theme from Cracker's Wither Storm Mod.

13 is replaced by the Withered Symbiont's second theme.

Mellohi is replaced by Springhop, a friend's creation

Blocks is replaced by Contradiction, by the same friend.


Netherite is now Lionsdale, a spaceborne material that was fully extracted from the overworld and lost upon entry to the nether.

Diamonds are now Mythril, the mythical metal of the elves. Might change this though to be something like Psimetal or something similar ^~^`
